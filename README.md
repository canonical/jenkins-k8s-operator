# jenkins-k8s-operator

**This is a WIP project.**

A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
deploying and managing [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) on Kubernetes. Jenkins is an open source
automation server, providing plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

Jenkins is an extendable open source continuous integration server that
monitors executions of repeated jobs. The focus of Jenkins is the
building/testing of software project continuously, and monitoring executions
of externally-run jobs. More information at http://jenkins-ci.org/.

This charm provides the Jenkins server service, and when paired with the
jenkins agent provides an easy way to deploy Jenkins.

For DevOps and SRE teams, this charm will make operating Jenkins simple and straightforward
through Juju's clean interface. Allowing both kubernetes and machine agent relations, it supports
multiple environments for automation.
