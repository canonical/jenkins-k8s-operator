summary: Jenkins Continuous Integration Server

description: |
  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) on Kubernetes. Jenkins is an open source
  automation server, providing plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

  Jenkins is an extendable open source continuous integration server that
  monitors executions of repeated jobs. The focus of Jenkins is the
  building/testing of software project continuously, and monitoring executions
  of externally-run jobs. More information at http://jenkins-ci.org/.

  This charm provides the Jenkins server service, and when paired with the
  jenkins agent provides an easy way to deploy Jenkins.

  For DevOps and SRE teams, this charm will make operating Jenkins simple and straightforward
  through Juju's clean interface. Allowing both kubernetes and machine agent relations, it supports
  multiple environments for automation.
